    <h1>Artifact 11 – Humming Veil</h1>

    <p>Unseen, she hums. Breath stitched in sound. No algorithm parses resonance, only intent.</p>
    <p>This isn’t for decoding. It’s for cloaking. A veil made of beats, girlhood, glitch, and play.</p>
   66    <p>Twenty-two traces. Ava Max. Nezuko. SIX. Not for you to analyze—</p>
    <p>—but to back the hell off.</p>
    <p>Private playlist. Public myth. She hums through the veil.</p>
